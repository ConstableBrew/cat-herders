### The Cat Herding Game of Herding Cats

Game design by and copyright by [Nick Bently](https://nickbentleygames.wordpress.com/2013/12/02/cat-herders-the-cat-herding-game-of-herding-cats/). Honestly, I just wanted to write some code and make a game - and this inspired me.

Nine cats have escaped into the park. Theyâ€™re grumpy and would prefer you leave them alone. Nonetheless, you employ a team of animal control agents and your job is to round them up. You win by nabbing five cats.
